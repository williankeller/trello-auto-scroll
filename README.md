#### Why?
We decided to create this extension simply because we could not get an overview of all the columns created within Trello.
So, this extension allow your Trello make a automatically scroll until the last column and back to the first card as a loop.
The most interesting thing is that you are able to set the time to pause in each column. It is also the time of transition animation between the columns.

#### How To Use?
1. Go to Chrome Web Store and search by **Trello Auto Scroll** (or use **[this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trello-auto-scroll/iheeklbhnidcdjfkonakkkbbjophomkk)** instead).
2. Click on **Add To Chrome** button.
3. Go to the Options page of the extension, and set the **Speed Parameters**.
4. Open your Trello Board it will **Scroll Automatically**.
