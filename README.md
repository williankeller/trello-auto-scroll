### Why?
We decided to create this extension simply because we couldn't get an overview of all the columns created within Trello.
So, this extension allow your Trello board make a automatically scroll until the last column and back to the first card as a loop.
The most interesting thing is that you are able to set the time to pause in each column. It is also the time of transition animation between the columns.
